# **Note:** this method is used by `send_file()` and shouldn't be called manually.
#
# The type comes from a static table, the way nginx and Apache do it: for a static file
# server the extension is the authoritative signal.
#
# An unknown or missing extension gives `application/octet-stream`, so that the browser
# downloads the file instead of guessing how to render it. Since we own everything under
# `public/`, that case means the table is missing an entry: it is logged.

# image types have no charset parameter.

# Public: Try to send the given file, or fail with 404.
#
# Takes the path to the file to send as a parameter.
#
# It will automatically create a valid HTTP response that will stream the content
# of the file, with the correct mime type and all. If the file doesn't exist, or
# if the file is outside of `public/`, send a 404 error.
#
# Every answer carries two cache validators: an `ETag` built from the size and mtime
# of the file, and its `Last-Modified` date. A conditional request that matches one
# of them (`If-None-Match` first, `If-Modified-Since` only when no usable ETag was sent)
# is answered with a bodyless `304 Not Modified`. An `If-None-Match` of `*` matches too.
#
# Only a GET or a HEAD is answered that way: a 304 to a POST would leave the client
# without a representation of what it just sent.
#
# Every answer also announces `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, and a GET carrying a single byte
# range (`Range: bytes=0-499`, `bytes=500-`, `bytes=-500`) is answered with a
# `206 Partial Content` and the matching `Content-Range` — what `<video>` seeking needs.
# A range starting past the end of the file is a `416 Range Not Satisfiable`. Every
# other form — several ranges, another unit, garbage — is ignored and the whole file is
# served, as RFC 9110 §14.2 allows; so is the whole header when an `If-Range` is present
# and is not exactly the current ETag.
#
# The path generally comes from the URL (`URL_BASE`). You just need to remove the first
# `/` to get a relative path.
#
# *Note* that to find the correct mimetype, we use `_get_mimetype()`, which deduces it from
# the extension of the file.
