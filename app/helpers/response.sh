# Public: Send a redirect to the given URL as an answer.

# Takes the target URL, and optionally the response code, one of the five redirects of
# RFC 9110 §15.4: 302 (the default) for a temporary redirect, 301 for a permanent one,
# 303 to tell the client to GET the target, and 307/308 as their method-preserving
# counterparts — a strict client may repeat a POST on a 301/302, only 303 guarantees the
# switch to GET. Anything else is refused with a 500: `send_response` would die expanding
# an unknown code mid-answer, and the client would get nothing at all.
#
# The typical use is POST-redirect-GET, so that a refresh doesn't resubmit the form —
# that is 303.
#
# A target holding a CR or a LF is refused with a 500 the same way: it would split the
# Location header in two. The rest is the caller's business — a target built from the request
# is an open redirect unless the script checks it, and a full URL is legitimate here, so the
# library cannot tell the wanted ones from the others.
#
# Like the other `send_*` functions, it exits: nothing after it runs.
#
# $1 - the URL to redirect to (a path like `/index.sh`, or a full URL)
# $2 - Optional: the response code, 301, 302, 303, 307 or 308 (default 302)

# Examples
#
#    send_redirect '/index.sh'
#
# will send an answer that starts with
